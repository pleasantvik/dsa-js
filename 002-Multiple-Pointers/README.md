# Multiple Pointers Pattern

- <h3>This pattern involves creating a pointer that correspond to an index or position in an array or string</h3>
- The pointers then move towards beginning end or middle based on a condition

`Use case`

- Useful when looking for a pair

## Pattern Explanation

**EXAMPLE**

- `Write a function that accepts a sorted array and returns the sum zero pair`

- [-3, -2,-1, 0, 3,5,7]

- Since the array is sorted, we can put the pointer at the begginning and another at the end of the array. Move the pointer left or right base on the result
