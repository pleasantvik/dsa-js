Write a function called sumZero, which accept a sorted array of intergers. The function should find the first pair that sum to zero. Return an array that meets the condition or undefined of there os no

**Example**
`Input: nums = [-3,-2,-1,3,11,7]
Output: [0,3]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[3] == 0, we return [0, 3].`

**Example 2:**

`Input: nums = [11,9,8,3,-3]
Output: [3,4]`

_Guaranteed constraints:_

- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- Only one valid answer
- Arrays are always sorted
