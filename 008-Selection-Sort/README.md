# Selection Sort

## Description

- This algorithm is similar to bubble sort but differs in that we place the smaller values into sorted position first

# PSEUDOCODE

- (1). Define the function which takes an array parameter

- (2). Loop over the array

        - Create a variable called lowestValue to hold the posiiton of the first element

- (3) Create a inner loop within the first loop, starting at i + 1

        - check if the arr in j is smaller than arr in lowest, if yes, update the value of lowest to j (index)
        - i

- (4) If the minimum is not the index we began with, swap

- (5) Return the array

## Big O

`BEST CASE`
O(n)

`WORST CASE` and `Average Case`

- Its O(n square)
