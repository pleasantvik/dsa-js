# Linear Search

- This works when searching through a list of arrays, string to determine if an elment is present.

- This functionality is built-in Javascript method such as
  `includes`
  `indexOf`
  `findIndex`

# Implementation

- It involves going through the list one at a time while comparing it with the target value

# PSEUDOCODE

- 1. Loop through the list
- 2.  Check if the current index is same as the target value

- 3. if they are equal, return from the function

- If they are not equal move to the next value and repeat step `2` and `3`

- If the value doesn't occur after going through the entire list, return -1

## Big O

`BEST CASE`
0(1)

`WORST CASE` and `Average Case`

- Its O(n): It grows as value of n grows
