# Binary Heap

- Has some similarities with BST, but with some different rules!
- In MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes while in MinBinaryHeap, a child node is always larger than parent node

# Rules: MaxHeap

- Each parent has at most two child nodes
- Parent is always greater than child
- Though parent is always greater than child, there are no guarentee amist siblings
- It is well compact as all children are as full as they can be and left children are filled first

# Priority Queue

- A data structure where element has priority associated with it
